Hello @spotby @keenerthanyou
How are you?
This is Johnny on Upwork.

Unfortunately, I can't login Upwork anymore.
I already sent messages to sp0tby@gmail.com.
But I didn't get any response from you.
My brother's account is also killed on Upwork.
I guess, Upwork checked our chat history.
I made new account.
https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/_~012764daab3c198ea6/

And don't contact to Upwork.
Then new account would be kill by Upwork.

Please send me offer on Upwork.
I don't want to occur problem anymore.
I am trying to give you best solution.
If you make payment to my email (cooldev727@hotmail.com), then I will not contact you anymore.
As you know, I worked full time for your project for 3 weeks and I didn't get money about my work.

And Please let me know your skype or email for communication.
Kind regards.
PS. If you can't resolve it on your side, then I have to find another solution for me.
I don't want to occur complex problems.
Please understand on my side.
Regards.
